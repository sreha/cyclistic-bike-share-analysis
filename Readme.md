# 🚲 Cyclistic Bike-Share Analysis

This project was completed as part of the Google Data Analytics Capstone.  
The aim was to explore how Cyclistic’s casual riders and annual members differ in their usage patterns — and how that information can support smarter marketing strategies.

## 📁 About the Project

Cyclistic is a fictional bike-share company in Chicago. As part of the analysis, I worked with over 13 months of real ride data to uncover trends and usage behaviors.

The goal was to provide actionable insights that could help convert casual riders into long-term annual members.

---

## 🔍 Key Questions Explored

- How do members and casual riders differ in ride frequency and duration?
- What days and times are most popular for each group?
- Which stations are most frequently used?
- Are there geographic or behavioral patterns in ride locations?

---

## 🛠 Tools Used

- **R & RStudio**: data cleaning, analysis, visualization
- **Libraries**: `tidyverse`, `lubridate`, `ggplot2`, `leaflet`, `janitor`
- **R Markdown**: for building the final report
- **GitHub Pages**: to publish the live version of the report

## 📊 Main Features of the Report

- Ride duration and volume broken down by member type and weekday
- Peak hours of usage for each user group
- Top 10 start stations across the dataset
- An interactive map using Leaflet showing ride starting locations
- Summary of findings with practical recommendations
